1)Apply Decision Tree Classifier on Winequality dataset to generate the following results.
  Classification Report , Confusion Matrix , Plot Decision Tree
2)Apply kMeans clustering on Wisconsin Dataset. Assume k=2 and plot a graph for the derived clusters. 
   Also generate elbow graph for this problem and check whether our assumption for k as 2 is true.also find centroides
