1)Apply Decision Tree Classifier on Winequality dataset to generate the following results.
  Classification Report , Confusion Matrix , Plot Decision Tree
2)Apply kMeans clustering on Wisconsin Dataset. Assume k=2 and plot a graph for the derived clusters. 
   Also generate elbow graph for this problem and check whether our assumption for k as 2 is true.also find centroides
3)Dataset: <Breast_Cancer.csv>
     (i) Conduct exploratory data analysis on the given dataset and report the details.
    (ii) Visualize the analysis results using (i) scatter plot (ii) histogram & (iii) box plot.
    (iii) Implement the k-NN classification algorithm using the dataset. Try with different k values and show the accuracy.
